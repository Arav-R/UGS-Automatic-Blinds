# UGS-Automatic Blinds
 
**Overview**

This project automates the opening and closing of window blinds using an Arduino microcontroller and servo motors. The system is designed to allow control of the blinds based on user input, light intensity, or a preset schedule. The main components of the system include an Arduino, servo motors, light sensors (optional), and a simple control interface (buttons, remote control, or a mobile app).

**Features**

Manual control: Use buttons or a remote to adjust the blinds' position.
Light-based control: Automatically adjusts blinds based on the ambient light intensity (using a light sensor).
Scheduled control: Pre-program opening and closing times for the blinds.
Customizable: Easily adjust the motor speed and angles to fit various types of blinds.

**Components**

Arduino Uno/Nano: The brain of the system that processes input and controls the servos.
Servo motors: Used to rotate the blinds up and down.
Light sensor (optional): Detects ambient light levels to automatically adjust the blinds.
Push buttons: For manual control.
Remote control/IR receiver (optional): For wireless control.
Power supply: To provide power to the Arduino and the servos.
Jumper wires, resistors, and breadboard: For wiring and testing the circuit.

**Setup**
1. Arduino and Servo Motor Wiring:
Connect the signal wire of the servo to one of the PWM pins (e.g., pin 9).
Connect the power and ground wires of the servo to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively.
2. Light Sensor (Optional):
Connect the sensor's output to an analog pin (e.g., A0).
Connect power and ground to the Arduino.
3. Push Buttons:
Connect one end of each button to ground.
Connect the other end to digital input pins (e.g., pins 2 and 3) with pull-up resistors.
4. Power Supply:
Power the Arduino with a 9V battery or external power supply (if needed).
Ensure that the servo motor is powered with a sufficient power supply to avoid overloading the Arduino.
Software

**Libraries Required:**
Servo.h: To control the servo motors.
Timer.h (optional): For scheduling the blind movements.
To install the libraries:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for "Servo" and click Install.

**Customization**
Adjust the servo angles: Modify the openBlinds() and closeBlinds() functions to set specific angles based on your blinds' requirements.
Light threshold: Modify the light level values (300 and 700) to suit your roomâ€™s lighting conditions.
Schedule control: You can add a timer function or a real-time clock module to schedule opening and closing times.

**Usage**
Manual Control: Press the "up" button to open the blinds and the "down" button to close them.
Light Control (optional): The blinds will automatically adjust based on the ambient light intensity if a light sensor is connected.
Scheduled Control (optional): Add a timer or real-time clock module to automate the blinds based on time.

**Future Improvements**
Add a mobile app or remote control functionality.
Implement temperature-based control by adding a temperature sensor.
Integrate with smart home systems like Alexa or Google Home.
